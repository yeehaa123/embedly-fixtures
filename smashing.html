    <p>Functional programming is the mustachioed hipster of programming
    paradigms. Originally relegated to the annals of computer science academia,
    functional programming has had a recent renaissance that is due largely to
    its utility in distributed systems (and probably also because \"pure\"
    functional languages like Haskell are difficult to grasp, which gives them
    a certain cachet).</p>\n
    <p>Stricter functional programming languages are typically used when a
    system's performance and integrity are both critical - i.e. your program
    needs to do exactly what you expect every time and needs to operate in an
    environment where its tasks can be shared across hundreds or thousands of
    networked computers. <a href=
    "/&quot;http://clojure.org//&quot;">Clojure</a>, for example, powers
    <a href="/&quot;http://www.akamai.com//&quot;">Akamai</a>, the massive
    content delivery network utilized by companies such as Facebook, while
    <a href=
    "/&quot;http://www.infoq.com/articles/twitter-java-use/&quot;">Twitter
    famously adopted</a><a href=
    "/&quot;http://www.scala-lang.org//&quot;">Scala</a> for its most
    performance-intensive components, and <a href=
    "/&quot;http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell/&quot;">Haskell</a> is
    used by AT&amp;T for its network security systems.</p>\n
    <p>These languages have a steep learning curve for most front-end web
    developers; however, many more approachable languages incorporate features
    of functional programming, most notably Python, both in its core library,
    with functions like <code>map</code> and <code>reduce</code> (which we'll
    talk about in a bit), and with libraries such as <a href=
    "/&quot;https://github.com/kachayev/fn.py/&quot;">Fn.py</a>, along with
    JavaScript, again using collection methods, but also with libraries such as
    <a href="/&quot;http://underscorejs.org//&quot;">Underscore.js</a> and
    <a href="/&quot;http://baconjs.github.io//&quot;">Bacon.js</a>.</p>\n

    <p>Functional programming can be daunting, but remember that it isn't only
    for PhDs, data scientists and architecture astronauts. For most of us, the
    real benefit of adopting a functional style is that our programs can be
    broken down into smaller, simpler pieces that are both more reliable and
    easier to understand. If you're a front-end developer working with data,
    especially if you're formatting that data for visualization using D3,
    Raphael or the like, then functional programming will be an essential
    weapon in your arsenal.</p>\n
    <p>Finding a consistent definition of functional programming is tough, and
    most of the literature relies on somewhat foreboding statements like
    \"functions as first-class objects,\" and \"eliminating side effects.\"
    Just in case that doesn't bend your brain into knots, at a more theoretical
    level, functional programming is often explained in terms of <a href=
    "/&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus/&quot;">lambda
    calculus</a> (some <a href=
    "/&quot;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/11916/is-functional-programming-a-branch-of-mathematics/&quot;">
    actually argue</a> that functional programming is basically math) - but you
    can relax. From a more pragmatic perspective, a beginner needs to
    understand only two concepts in order to use it for everyday applications
    (no calculus required!).</p>\n
    <p>First, data in functional programs should be <strong>immutable</strong>,
    which sounds serious but just means that it should never change. At first,
    this might seem odd (after all, who needs a program that never changes
    anything?), but in practice, you would simply create new data structures
    instead of modifying ones that already exist. For example, if you need to
    manipulate some data in an array, then you'd make a new array with the
    updated values, rather than revise the original array. Easy!</p>\n
    <p>Secondly, functional programs should be <strong>stateless</strong>,
    which basically means they should perform every task as if for the first
    time, with no knowledge of what may or may not have happened earlier in the
    program's execution (you might say that a stateless program is ignorant of
    the past). Combined with immutability, this helps us think of each function
    as if it were operating in a vacuum, blissfully ignorant of anything else
    in the application besides other functions. In more concrete terms, this
    means that your functions will operate only on data passed in as arguments
    and will never rely on outside values to perform their calculations.</p>\n
    <p>Immutability and statelessness are core to functional programming and
    are important to understand, but don't worry if they don't quite make sense
    yet. You'll be familiar with these principles by the end of the article,
    and I promise that the beauty, precision and power of functional
    programming will turn your applications into bright, shiny, data-chomping
    rainbows. For now, start with simple functions that return data (or other
    functions), and then combine those basic building blocks to perform more
    complex tasks.</p>\n
    <p>For example, let's say we have an API response:</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>var data = [ { name: \"Jamestown\", population: 2047, temperatures: [-34, 67, 101, 87] }, { name: \"Awesome Town\", population: 3568, temperatures: [-3, 4, 9, 12] } { name: \"Funky Town\", population: 1000000, temperatures: [75, 75, 75, 75, 75] } ]; </code></pre>\n
    <p>If we want to use a chart or graphing library to compare the average
    temperature to population size, we'd need to write some JavaScript that
    makes a few changes to the data before it's formatted correctly for our
    visualization. Our graphing library wants an array of x and y coordinates,
    like so:</p>\n
    <p>Here, <code>x</code> is the average temperature, and <code>y</code> is
    the population size.</p>\n
    <p>Without functional programming (or without using what's called an
    \"imperative\" style), our program might look like this:</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>var coords = [], totalTemperature = 0, averageTemperature = 0; for (var i=0; i &lt; data.length; i++) { totalTemperature = 0; for (var j=0; j &lt; data[i].temperatures.length; j++) { totalTemperature += data[i].temperatures[j]; } averageTemperature = totalTemperature / data[i].temperatures.length; coords.push([averageTemperature, data[i].population]); } </code></pre>\n
    <p>Even in a contrived example, this is already becoming difficult to
    follow. Let's see if we can do better.</p>\n
    <p>When programming in a functional style, you're always looking for
    simple, repeatable actions that can be abstracted out into a function. We
    can then build more complex features by calling these functions in sequence
    (also known as \"composing\" functions) - more on that in a second. In the
    meantime, let's look at the steps we'd take in the process of transforming
    the initial API response to the structure required by our visualization
    library. At a basic level, we'll perform the following actions on our
    data:</p>\n
    <ul>
      <li>add every number in a list,</li>
      <li style="list-style: none">\n\t</li>
      <li>calculate an average,</li>
      <li style="list-style: none">\n\t</li>
      <li>retrieve a single property from a list of objects.</li>
      <li style="list-style: none">\n</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We'll write a function for each of these three basic actions, then
    compose our program from those functions. Functional programming can be a
    little confusing at first, and you'll probably be tempted to slip into old
    imperative habits. To avoid that, here are some simple ground rules to
    ensure that you're following best practices:</p>\n
    <ol>
      <li>All of your functions must accept at least one argument.\n\t</li>
      <li>All of your functions must return data or another function.\n\t</li>
      <li>No loops!\n</li>
    </ol>
    <p>OK, let's add every number in a list. Remembering the rules, let's make
    sure that our function accepts an argument (the array of numbers to add)
    and returns some data.</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>function totalForArray(arr) { // add everything return total; } </code></pre>\n
    <p>So far so good. But how are we going to access every item in the list if
    we don't loop over it? Say hello to your new friend, recursion! This is a
    bit tricky, but basically, when you use recursion, you create a function
    that calls itself unless a specific condition has been met - in which case,
    a value is returned. Just looking at an example is probably easiest:</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>// Notice we're accepting two values, the list and the current total function totalForArray(currentTotal, arr) { currentTotal += arr[0]; // Note to experienced JavaScript programmers, I'm not using Array.shift on // purpose because we're treating arrays as if they are immutable. var remainingList = arr.slice(1); // This function calls itself with the remainder of the list, and the // current value of the currentTotal variable if(remainingList.length &gt; 0) { return totalForArray(currentTotal, remainingList); } // Unless of course the list is empty, in which case we can just return // the currentTotal value. else { return currentTotal; } } </code></pre>\n
    <p><strong>A word of caution:</strong> Recursion will make your programs
    more readable, and it is essential to programming in a functional style.
    However, in some languages (including JavaScript), you'll run into problems
    when your program makes a large number of recursive calls in a single
    operation (at the time of writing, \"large\" is about <a href=
    "/&quot;http://www.2ality.com/2014/04/call-stack-size.html/&quot;">10,000
    calls in Chrome, 50,000 in Firefox and 11,000 in Node.js</a>). The details
    are beyond the scope of this article, but the gist is that, at least
    <a href=
    "/&quot;https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html#sec-tail-position-calls/&quot;">
    until ECMAScript 6 is released</a>, JavaScript doesn't support something
    called \"tail recursion,\" which is a more efficient form of recursion.
    This is an advanced topic and won't come up very often, but it's worth
    knowing.</p>\n
    <p>With that out of the way, remember that we needed to calculate the total
    temperature from an array of temperatures in order to then calculate the
    average. Now, instead of looping over each item in the
    <code>temperatures</code> array, we can simply write this:</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>var totalTemp = totalForArray(0, temperatures); </code></pre>\n
    <p>If you're purist, you might say that our <code>totalForArray</code>
    function could be broken down even further. For example, the task of adding
    two numbers together will probably come up in other parts of your
    application and subsequently should really be its own function.</p>\n
    <pre><code>function addNumbers(a, b) { return a + b; } </code></pre>\n
    <p>Now, our <code>totalForArray</code> function looks like this:</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>function totalForArray(currentTotal, arr) { currentTotal = addNumbers(currentTotal, arr[0]); var remainingArr = arr.slice(1); if(remainingArr.length &gt; 0) { return totalForArray(currentTotal, remainingArr); } else { return currentTotal; } } </code></pre>\n
    <p>Excellent! Returning a single value from an array is fairly common in
    functional programming, so much so that it has a special name,
    \"reduction,\" which you'll more commonly hear as a verb, like when you
    \"reduce an array to a single value.\" JavaScript has a special method just
    for performing this common task. Mozilla Developer Network provides a
    <a href=
    "/&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce/&quot;">
    full explanation</a>, but for our purposes it's as simple as this:</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>// The reduce method takes a function as its first argument, and that function // accepts both the current item in the list and the current total result from // whatever calculation you're performing. var totalTemp = temperatures.reduce(function(previousValue, currentValue){ // After this calculation is returned, the next currentValue will be // previousValue + currentValue, and the next previousValue will be the // next item in the array. return previousValue + currentValue; }); </code></pre>\n
    <p>But, hey, since we've already defined an <code>addNumber</code>
    function, we can just use that instead.</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>var totalTemp = temperatures.reduce(addNumbers); </code></pre>\n
    <p>In fact, because totalling up an array is so cool, let's put that into
    its own function so that we can use it again without having to remember all
    of that confusing stuff about reduction and recursion.</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>function totalForArray(arr) { return arr.reduce(addNumbers); } var totalTemp = totalForArray(temperatures); </code></pre>\n
    <p>Ah, now <em>that</em> is some readable code! Just so you know, methods
    such as <code>reduce</code> are common in most functional programming
    languages. These helper methods that perform actions on arrays in lieu of
    looping are often called \"higher-order functions.\"</p>\n
    <p>Moving right along, the second task we listed was calculating an
    average. This is pretty easy.</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>function average(total, count) { return total / count; } </code></pre>\n
    <p>How might we go about getting the average for an entire array?</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>function averageForArray(arr) { return average(totalForArray(arr), arr.length); } var averageTemp = averageForArray(temperatures); </code></pre>\n
    <p>Hopefully, you're starting to see how to combine functions to perform
    more complex tasks. This is possible because we're following the rules set
    out at the beginning of this article - namely, that our functions must
    always accept arguments and return data. Pretty awesome.</p>\n
    <p>Lastly, we wanted to retrieve a single property from an array of
    objects. Instead of showing you more examples of recursion, I'll cut to the
    chase and clue you in on another built-in JavaScript method: <a href=
    "/&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map/&quot;">
    map</a>. This method is for when you have an array with one structure and
    need to map it to another structure, like so:</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>// The map method takes a single argument, the current item in the list. Check // out the link above for more complete examples. var allTemperatures = data.map(function(item) { return item.temperatures; }); </code></pre>\n
    <p>That's pretty cool, but pulling a single property from a collection of
    objects is something you'll be doing all the time, so let's make a function
    just for that.</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>// Pass in the name of the property that you'd like to retrieve function getItem(propertyName) { // Return a function that retrieves that item, but don't execute the function. // We'll leave that up to the method that is taking action on items in our // array. return function(item) { return item[propertyName]; } } </code></pre>\n
    <p>Check it out: We've made a function that returns a function! Now we can
    pass it to the <code>map</code> method like this:</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>var temperatures = data.map(getItem('temperature')); </code></pre>\n
    <p>In case you like details, the reason we can do this is because, in
    JavaScript, functions are \"first-class objects,\" which basically means
    that you can pass around functions just like any other value. While this is
    a feature of many programming languages, it's a requirement of any language
    that can be used in a functional style. Incidentally, this is also the
    reason you can do stuff like <code>$('#my-element').on('click', function(e)
    ... )</code>. The second argument in the <code>on</code> method is a
    <code>function</code>, and when you pass functions as arguments, you're
    using them just like you would use values in imperative languages. Pretty
    neat.</p>\n
    <p>Finally, let's wrap the call to <code>map</code> in its own function to
    make things a little more readable.</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>function pluck(arr, propertyName) { return arr.map(getItem(propertyName)); } var allTemperatures = pluck(data, 'temperatures'); </code></pre>\n
    <p>All right, now we have a toolkit of generic functions that we can use
    anywhere in our application, even in other projects. We can tally up the
    items in an array, get the average value of an array, and make new arrays
    by plucking properties from lists of objects. Last but not least, let's
    return to our original problem:</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>var data = [ { name: \"Jamestown\", population: 2047, temperatures: [-34, 67, 101, 87] }, ... ]; </code></pre>\n
    <p>We need to transform an array of objects like the one above into an
    array of <code>x, y</code> pairs, like this:</p>\n
    <pre><code>[ [75, 1000000], ... ]; </code></pre>\n
    <p>Here, <code>x</code> is the average temperature, and <code>y</code> is
    the total population. First, let's isolate the data that we need.</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>var populations = pluck(data, 'population'); var allTemperatures = pluck(data, 'temperatures'); </code></pre>\n
    <p>Now, let's make an array of averages. Remember that the function we pass
    to <code>map</code> will be called on each item in the array; so, the
    returned value of that passed function will be added to a new array, and
    that new array will ultimately be assigned to our <code>averageTemps</code>
    variable.</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>var averageTemps = allTemperatures.map(averageForArray); </code></pre>\n
    <p>So far so good. But now we have two arrays:</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>// populations [2047, 3568, 1000000] // averageTemps [55.25, 5.5, 75] </code></pre>\n
    <p>Obviously, we want only one array, so let's write a function to combine
    them. Our function should make sure that the item at index <code>0</code>
    in the first array is paired with the item at index <code>0</code> in the
    second array, and so on for indexes <code>1</code> to <code>n</code> (where
    <code>n</code> is the total number of items in the array).</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>function combineArrays(arr1, arr2, finalArr) { // Just so we don't have to remember to pass an empty array as the third // argument when calling this function, we'll set a default. finalArr = finalArr || []; // Push the current element in each array into what we'll eventually return finalArr.push([arr1[0], arr2[0]]); var remainingArr1 = arr1.slice(1), remainingArr2 = arr2.slice(1); // If both arrays are empty, then we're done if(remainingArr1.length === 0 &amp;&amp; remainingArr2.length === 0) { return finalArr; } else { // Recursion! return combineArrays(remainingArr1, remainingArr2, finalArr); } }; var processed = combineArrays(averageTemps, populations); </code></pre>\n
    <p>Or, because one-liners are fun:</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>var processed = combineArrays(pluck(data, 'temperatures').map(averageForArray), pluck(data, 'population')); // [ // [ 55.25, 2047 ], // [ 5.5, 3568 ], // [ 75, 1000000 ] // ] </code></pre>\n
    <h3>Let's Get Real <a href=
    "/&quot;https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/07/dont-be-scared-of-functional-programming/#lets-get-real/&quot;">
    Link</a>\n</h3>\n
    <p>Last but not least, let's look at one more real-world example, this time
    adding to our functional toolbelt with <a href=
    "/&quot;http://underscorejs.org//&quot;">Underscore.js</a>, a JavaScript
    library that provides a number of great functional programming helpers.
    We'll pull data from a platform for conflict and disaster information that
    I've been working on named <a href=
    "/&quot;http://crisis.net/&quot;">CrisisNET</a>, and we'll use the
    fantastic <a href="/&quot;http://d3js.org/&quot;">D3</a> library to
    visualize that data.</p>\n
    <p>The goal is to give people coming to CrisisNET's home page a quick
    snapshot of the types of information in the system. To demonstrate this, we
    could count the number of documents from the API that are assigned to a
    particular category, like \"physical violence\" or \"armed conflict.\" This
    way, the user can see how much information is available on the topics they
    find most interesting.</p>\n
    <p>A bubble chart might be a good fit, because they are often used to
    represent the relative sizes of large groups of people. Fortunately, D3 has
    a built-in visualization named <code>pack</code> for just this purpose. So,
    let's create a graph with <code>pack</code> that shows the number of times
    that a given category's name appears in a response from CrisisNET's
    API.</p>\n
    <p>Before we go on, note that D3 is a complex library that warrants its own
    tutorial (or many tutorials, for that matter). Because this article is
    focused on functional programming, we won't spend a lot of time on how D3
    works. But don't worry - if you're not already familiar with the library,
    you should be able to copy and paste the code snippets specific to D3 and
    dig into the details another time. <a href=
    "/&quot;http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3/&quot;">Scott Murray's D3
    tutorials</a> are a great resource if you're interested in learning
    more.</p>\n
    <p>Moving along, let's first make sure we have a DOM element, so that D3
    has some place to put the chart it will generate with our data.</p>\n
    <p>Now, let's create our chart and add it to the DOM.</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>// width of chart var diameter = 960, format = d3.format(\",d\"), // creates an ordinal scale with 20 colors. See D3 docs for hex values color = d3.scale.category20c(), // chart object to which we'll be adding data var bubble = d3.layout.pack() .sort(null) .size([diameter, diameter]) .padding(1.5); // Add an SVG to the DOM that our pack object will use to draw the // visualization. var svg = d3.select(\"#bubble-graph\").append(\"svg\") .attr(\"width\", diameter) .attr(\"height\", diameter) .attr(\"class\", \"bubble\"); </code></pre>\n
    <p>The <code>pack</code> object takes an array of objects in this
    format:</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>{ children: [ { className: , package: \"cluster\", value: } ] } </code></pre>\n
    <p>CrisisNET's data API returns information in this format:</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>{ data: [ { summary: \"Example summary\", content: \"Example content\", ... tags: [ { name: \"physical-violence\", confidence: 1 } ] } ] } </code></pre>\n
    <p>We see that each document has a <code>tags</code> property, and that
    property contains an array of items. Each tag item has a <code>name</code>
    property, which is what we're after. We need to find each unique tag name
    in CrisisNET's API response and count the number of times that tag name
    appears. Let's start by isolating the information we need using the
    <code>pluck</code> function that we created earlier.</p>\n
    <pre><code>var tagArrays = pluck(data, 'tags'); </code></pre>\n
    <p>This gives us an array of arrays, like this:</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>[ [ { name: \"physical-violence\", confidence: 1 } ], [ { name: \"conflict\", confidence: 1 } ] ] </code></pre>\n
    <p>However, what we really want is one array with every tag in it. So,
    let's use a handy function from Underscore.js named <a href=
    "/&quot;http://underscorejs.org/#flatten/&quot;">flatten</a>. This will
    take values from any nested arrays and give us an array that is one level
    deep.</p>\n
    <pre><code>var tags = _.flatten(tagArrays); </code></pre>\n
    <p>Now, our array is a little easier to deal with:</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>[ { name: \"physical-violence\", confidence: 1 }, { name: \"conflict\", confidence: 1 } ] </code></pre>\n
    <p>We can use <code>pluck</code> again to get the thing we really want,
    which is a simple list of only the tag names.</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>var tagNames = pluck(tags, 'name'); [ \"physical-violence\", \"conflict\" ] </code></pre>\n
    <p>Ah, that's better.</p>\n
    <p>Now we're down to the relatively straightforward tasks of counting the
    number of times each tag name appears in our list and then transforming
    that list into the structure required by the D3 <code>pack</code> layout
    that we created earlier. As you've probably noticed, arrays are a pretty
    popular data structure in functional programming - most of the tools are
    designed with arrays in mind. As a first step, then, we'll create an array
    like this:</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>[ [ \"physical-violence\", 10 ], [ \"conflict\", 27 ] ] </code></pre>\n
    <p>Here, each item in the array has the tag name at index <code>0</code>
    and that tag's total count at index <code>1</code>. We want only one array
    for each unique tag name, so let's start by creating an array in which each
    tag name appears only once. Fortunately, an Underscore.js method exists
    just for this purpose.</p>\n
    <pre><code>var tagNamesUnique = _.uniq(tagNames); </code></pre>\n
    <p>Let's also get rid of any <code>false-y</code> ( <code>false</code>,
    <code>null</code>, <code>\"\"</code>, etc.) values using another handy
    Underscore.js function.</p>\n
    <pre><code>tagNamesUnique = _.compact(tagNamesUnique); </code></pre>\n
    <p>From here, we can write a function that generates our arrays using
    another built-in JavaScript collection method, named <a href=
    "/&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter/&quot;">
    filter</a>, that filters an array based on a condition.</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>function makeArrayCount(keys, arr) { // for each of the unique tagNames return keys.map(function(key) { return [ key, // Find all the elements in the full list of tag names that match this key // and count the size of the returned array. arr.filter(function(item) { return item === key; }).length ] }); } </code></pre>\n
    <p>We can now easily create the data structure that <code>pack</code>
    requires by mapping our list of arrays.</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>var packData = makeArrayCount(tagNamesUnique, tagNames).map(function(tagArray) { return { className: tagArray[0], package: \"cluster\", value: tagArray[1] } }); </code></pre>\n
    <p>Finally, we can pass our data to D3 and generate DOM nodes in our SVG,
    one circle for each unique tag name, sized relative to the total number of
    times that tag name appeared in CrisisNET's API response.</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>function setGraphData(data) { var node = svg.selectAll(\".node\") // Here's where we pass our data to the pack object. .data(bubble.nodes(data) .filter(function(d) { return !d.children; })) .enter().append(\"g\") .attr(\"class\", \"node\") .attr(\"transform\", function(d) { return \"translate(\" + d.x + \",\" + d.y + \")\"; }); // Append a circle for each tag name. node.append(\"circle\") .attr(\"r\", function(d) { return d.r; }) .style(\"fill\", function(d) { return color(d.className); }); // Add a label to each circle, using the tag name as the label's text node.append(\"text\") .attr(\"dy\", \".3em\") .style(\"text-anchor\", \"middle\") .style(\"font-size\", \"10px\") .text(function(d) { return d.className } ); } </code></pre>\n
    <p>Putting it all together, here's the <code>setGraphData</code> and
    <code>makeArray</code> functions in context, including a call to
    CrisisNET's API using jQuery (you'll need to <a href=
    "/&quot;http://api.crisis.net/&quot;">get an API key</a>). I've also posted
    a <a href=
    "/&quot;https://github.com/gati/lilfunc/blob/master/smashing.html/&quot;">fully
    working example on GitHub</a>.</p>\n
    <pre>
        <code>function processData(dataResponse) { var tagNames = pluck(_.flatten(pluck(dataResponse.data, 'tags')), 'name'); var tagNamesUnique = _.uniq(tagNames); var packData = makeArrayCount(tagNamesUnique, tagNames).map(function(tagArray) { return { className: tagArray[0], package: \"cluster\", value: tagArray[1] } }); return packData; } function updateGraph(dataResponse) { setGraphData(processData(dataResponse)); } var apikey = // Get an API key here: http://api.crisis.net var dataRequest = $.get('http://api.crisis.net/item?limit=100&amp;apikey=' + apikey); dataRequest.done( updateGraph ); </code></pre>\n
    <p>That was a pretty deep dive, so congratulations on sticking with it! As
    I mentioned, these concepts can be challenging at first, but resist the
    temptation to hammer out <code>for</code> loops for the rest of your
    life.</p>\n
    <p>Within a few weeks of using functional programming techniques, you'll
    quickly build up a set of simple, reusable functions that will dramatically
    improve the readability of your applications. Plus, you'll be able to
    manipulate data structures significantly more quickly, knocking out what
    used to be 30 minutes of frustrating debugging in a couple lines of code.
    Once your data has been formatted correctly, you'll get to spend more time
    on the fun part: making the visualization look awesome!</p>\n
