    <p>A <a href=
    "/&quot;http://jlongster.com/The-Seasonal-Blog-Redux/&quot;">little while
    ago</a> I briefly talked about my latest blog rewrite and promised to go
    more in-depth on specific things I learned. Today I'm going to talk about
    immutable data structures in JavaScript, specifically two libraries
    <a href="/&quot;https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/&quot;">immutable.js</a>
    and <a href=
    "/&quot;https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable/&quot;">seamless-immutable</a>.
    There are other libraries, but the choice is conceptually between truly
    persistent data structures or copying native JavaScript objects, and
    comparing these two highlights the tradeoffs, no matter what specific
    library you choose <a href=
    "/&quot;http://jlongster.com/Using-Immutable-Data-Structures-in-JavaScript#footnote1/&quot;">
    [1]</a>. I'll also talk a little about <a href=
    "/&quot;https://github.com/cognitect/transit-js/&quot;">transit-js</a>,
    which is a great way to serialize anything.</p>\n
    <p>Very little of this applies specifically to <a href=
    "/&quot;https://github.com/rackt/redux/&quot;">Redux</a>. I talk about
    using immutable data structures generally, but provide pointers for using
    it specifically in Redux. In Redux, you have a single app state object and
    update it immutably, and there are various ways to achieve this, each with
    tradeoffs. I explore this below.</p>\n
    <p>One thing to think about with Redux is how you combine <a href=
    "/&quot;http://rackt.github.io/redux/docs/basics/Reducers.html/&quot;">reducers</a>
    to form the single app state atom; the default method that Redux provides (
    <code>combineReducers</code>) assumes that you are combining multiple
    values into a single JavaScript object. If you really want to combine them
    into a single Immutable.js object, for example, you would need to write
    your own <code>combineReducers</code> that does so. This might be necessary
    if you need to serialize your app state and you assume that it's entirely
    made up of Immutable.js objects.</p>\n
    <p>Most of this applies to using immutable objects in JavaScript in
    general. It's a bit awkward sometimes because you're fighting the default
    semantics, and it can feel like you're juggling types. However, depending
    on your app and how you set things up, you can get a lot out of it.</p>\n
    <p>Currently there is <a href=
    "/&quot;https://github.com/sebmarkbage/ecmascript-immutable-data-structures/&quot;">
    a proposal</a> for adding immutable data structures to JavaScript natively,
    but it's not clear if it will work out yet. It would certainly remove most
    problems with using them in JavaScript currently.</p>\n
    <h2>Immutable.js</h2>\n
    <p><a href=
    "/&quot;https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/&quot;">Immutable.js</a>
    comes from Facebook and is one of the most popular implementations of
    immutable data structures. It's the real deal; it implements fully
    persistent data structures from scratch using advanced things like <a href=
    "/&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie/&quot;">tries</a> to implement
    structural sharing. All updates return new values, but internally
    structures are shared to drastically reduce memory usage (and GC
    thrashing). This means that if you append to a vector with 1000 elements,
    it does <em>not</em> actually create a new vector 1001-elements long. Most
    likely, internally only a few small objects are allocated.</p>\n
    <p>The advancements of structural sharing data structures, greatly helped
    with the <a href=
    "/&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki/dp/0521663504/&quot;">
    groundbreaking work</a> by Okasaki, has all but shattered the myth that
    immutable values are too slow for Real Apps. In fact, it's surprising how
    many apps can be made <em>faster</em> with them. Apps which read and copy
    data structures heavily (to avoid being mutated from someone else) will
    easily benefit from immutable data structures (simply copying a large array
    once will diminish your performance wins from mutability).</p>\n
    <p>Another example is how <a href=
    "/&quot;https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/&quot;">ClojureScript</a>
    discovered that UIs are given a huge performance boost when backed by
    immutable data structures. If you're mutating a UI, you commonly touch the
    DOM more than necessary (because you don't know whether the value needs
    updating or not). React will minimize DOM mutations, but you still need to
    generate the virtual DOM for it to work with. When components are
    immutable, you don't even have to generate the virtual DOM; a simple
    <code>===</code> equality check tells you if it needs to update or
    not.</p>\n
    <p>Is it Too Good to Be True? You might wonder why we don't use immutable
    data structures all the time with the benefits they provide. Well, some
    languages do, like ClojureScript and Elm. It's harder in JavaScript because
    they are not the default in the language, so we need to weigh the pros and
    cons.</p>\n
    <h3>Space and GC Efficiency</h3>\n
    <p>I already explained why structural sharing makes immutable data
    structures efficient. Nothing is going to beat mutating an array at an
    index, but the overhead of immutability isn't large. If you need to avoid
    mutations, they are going to beat copying objects hands-down.</p>\n
    <p>In Redux, immutability is enforced. You won't see any updates on the
    screen unless you return a new value. There are big wins because of this,
    and if you want to avoid copying you might want to look at
    Immutable.js.</p>\n
    <h3>Reference &amp; Value Equality</h3>\n
    <p>Let's say you internally stored a reference to an object, and called it
    <code>obj1</code>. Later on, <code>obj2</code> comes down the pipe. If you
    never mutate objects, and <code>obj1 === obj2</code> is true, you know
    absolutely nothing has changed. In many architectures, like React, this
    allows you easily do powerful optimizations.</p>\n
    <p>That's called \"reference equality,\" where you can simply just compare
    pointers. But there's also the concept of \"value equality,\" where you can
    check if two objects are identical by doing <code>obj1.equals(obj2)</code>.
    When things are immutable, you treat objects as just values.</p>\n
    <p>In ClojureScript everything is a value, and even the default equality
    operator performs the value equality check (as if <code>===</code> would).
    If you actually wanted to compare instances you would use
    <code>identical?</code>. The benefit of value equality with immutable data
    structures is that it can usually do the checks more performantly than a
    full recursive scan (if it shares structure it can skip that part).</p>\n
    <p>So where does this come into play? I already explained how it makes
    optimizing React trivial. Just implement <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code>
    and check if the state is identical, and skip rendering if so.</p>\n
    <p>I also discovered that while using <code>===</code> with Immutable.js
    does not perform a value equality check (obviously, you can't override
    JavaScript's semantics), Immutable.js uses value equality for identities of
    objects. Anywhere that it wants to check if objects are the same, it uses
    value equality.</p>\n
    <p>For example, keys of a <code>Map</code> object are value equality
    checked. This means I can store an object in a <code>Map</code>, and
    retrieve it later just by supplying an object of the same shape:</p>\n
    <pre>
    <code>let map = Immutable.Map(); map = map.set(Immutable.Map({ x: 1, y: 2}), \"value\"); map.get(Immutable.Map({ x: 1, y: 2 })); </code></pre>\n
    <p>This has a <em>lot</em> of really nice implications. For example, let's
    say I have a function that takes a query object that specifies fields to
    pull from a server:</p>\n
    <pre>
    <code>{ return fetchFromServer(serialize(query)); } runQuery(Immutable.Map({ select: 'users', filter: { name: 'James' } })); </code></pre>\n
    <p>If I wanted to implement query caching, this is all I would have to
    do:</p>\n
    <pre>
    <code>let queryCache = Immutable.Map(); { let cached = queryCache.get(query); if(cached) { return cached; } else { let results = fetchFromServer(serialize(query)); queryCache = queryCache.set(query, results); return results; } } </code></pre>\n
    <p>I can treat the query object as a value, and store the results with it
    as a key. Later on, if something runs the same query, I'll get back the
    cached results even if the query object isn't the same instance.</p>\n
    <p>There are all sorts of patterns that value equality simplifies. In fact,
    I do the exact same technique when <a href=
    "/&quot;https://github.com/jlongster/blog/blob/master/src/reducers/posts.js#L34/&quot;">
    querying for posts</a>.</p>\n
    <h3>JavaScript Interop</h3>\n
    <p>The major downside to Immutable.js data structures is the reason that
    they are able to implement all the above features: they are not normal
    JavaScript data structures. An Immutable.js object is completely different
    from a JavaScript object.</p>\n
    <p>That means you must do <code>map.get(\"property\")</code> instead of
    <code>map.property</code>, and <code>array.get(0)</code> instead of
    <code>array[0]</code>. While Immutable.js goes to great lengths to provide
    JavaScript-compatible APIs, even they are different ( <code>push</code>
    must return a new array instead of mutating the existing instance). You can
    feel it fighting the default mutation-heavy semantics of JavaScript.</p>\n
    <p>The reason this makes things complicated is that unless you're really
    hardcore and are starting a project from scratch, you can't use Immutable
    objects everywhere. You don't really need to anyway for local objects of
    small functions. Even if you create every single object/array/etc as
    immutable, you're going to have to work with 3rd party libraries which use
    normal JavaScript objects/arrays/etc.</p>\n
    <p>The result is that you never know if you are working with a JavaScript
    object or an Immutable one. This makes reasoning about functions harder.
    While it's possible to be clear where you are using immutable objects, you
    still pass them through the system into places where it's not clear.</p>\n
    <p>In fact, sometimes you might be tempted to put a normal JavaScript
    object inside an Immutable map. Don't do this. Mixing immutable and mutable
    state in the same object will reap confusion.</p>\n
    <p>I see two solutions to this:</p>\n
    <ol>
      <li>\n
        <p><strong>Use a type system like TypeScript or Flow</strong>. This
        removes the mental burden of remembering where immutable data
        structures are flowing through the system. Many projects are not
        willing to take this step though, as it requires quite a different
        coding style.</p>\n\n\t
      </li>
      <li>\n
        <p><strong>Hide the details about data structures</strong>. If you are
        using Immutable.js in a specific part of your system, don't make
        anything outside of it access the data structures directly. A good
        example is Redux and it's single atom app state. If the app state is an
        Immutable.js object, don't force React components to use Immutable.js'
        API directly.</p>\n
        <p>There are two ways to do this. The first is to use something like
        <a href=
        "/&quot;https://github.com/gozala/typed-immutable/&quot;">typed-immutable</a>
        and actually <em>type</em> your objects. By creating records, you get a
        thin wrapper around an Immutable.js object that provides a
        <code>map.property</code> interface by defining getters based on the
        fields provided by the record type. Everything that just reads from the
        object can treat it like a normal JavaScript object. You can't mutate
        it still, but that's something you actually want to enforce.</p>\n
        <p>The second method is to provide a way to query objects and force
        anything that wants to read to perform a query. This doesn't work in
        general, but it works really well in the case of Redux because we have
        a single app state object, and you want to hide the data layout anyway.
        Forcing all React components to depend on the data layout means you can
        never change the actual structure of the app state, which you'll
        probably want to do over time.</p>\n
        <p>Queries don't have to be a sophisticated engine for deep object
        querying, they can just be simple function. I'm not doing this in my
        blog yet, but imagine if I had a bunch of functions like
        <code>getPost(state, id)</code> and
        <code>getEditorSettings(state)</code>. These all take state and return
        what I am \"querying\" just by using the function. I no longer care
        about where it lives within the state. The only problem is that I might
        still return an immutable object, so I might need to coerce that into a
        JavaScript object first or use a record type as described
        above.</p>\n\n
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>To sum it all up: JavaScript interop is a real issue. Never reference
    JavaScript objects from Immutable ones. Interop issues can be mitigated
    with record types as provided with <a href=
    "/&quot;https://github.com/gozala/typed-immutable/&quot;">typed-immutable</a>,
    which have other interesting benefits like throwing errors when mutating or
    reading invalid fields. Finally, if you're using Redux, don't force
    everything to depend on the app state structure, as you'll want to change
    it later. Abstract the data implementation away, which solves the problem
    with immutable interop.</p>\n
    <h2>seamless-immutable</h2>\n
    <p>There's another way to enforce immutability. The <a href=
    "/&quot;https://github.com/rtfeldman/seamless-immutable/&quot;">seamless-immutable</a>
    project is a much lighter-weight solution that uses normal JavaScript
    objects. It does not implement new data structures, so <em>there is no
    structural sharing</em>, which means you will copy objects as you update
    them (however, you only need a shallow copy). You don't get any of the
    performance or value equality benefits explained above.</p>\n
    <p>However, in return you get excellent JavaScript interop. All the data
    structures are quite literally JavaScript data structures. The difference
    is that that seamless-immutable calls <code>Object.freeze</code> on them,
    so you cannot mutate them (and strict mode, which is the default with ES6
    modules, will throw errors on mutation). Additionally, it adds a few
    methods to each instance to aid in updating the data, like
    <code>merge</code> which returns a new object with the supplied properties
    merged in.</p>\n
    <p>It's missing a few common methods for updating immutable data
    structures, like Immutable.js' and methods which makes it easy to update a
    deeply nested object. But these are easily implemented and I plan to
    contribute these to the project.</p>\n
    <p>It's impossible to mix immutable and mutable objects. seamless-immutable
    will deeply convert all objects to be immutable when wrapping an instance
    with it, and any added values are automatically wrapped. In practice
    Immutable.js works very similarly, where <code>Immutable.fromJS</code>
    deeply converts, as well as various methods like <code>obj.merge</code>.
    But <code>obj.set</code> does not automatically coerce, so you can store
    any data type you like. This is not possible with seamless-immutable, so
    you cannot accidentally store a mutable JavaScript object.</p>\n
    <p>In my opinion, I would expect each library to behave the way they
    currently do; they have different goals. For example, because
    seamless-immutable automatically coerces, you cannot store any type that it
    is not aware of, so it won't play nicely with anything but basic builtin
    types (in fact, it does not even support <code>Map</code> or
    <code>Set</code> types right now).</p>\n
    <p>seamless-immutable is a tiny libary with big wins, but also loses out on
    some fundamental advantages of immutable data structures like value
    equality. If JavaScript interop is a huge concern for you, it's a fantastic
    solution. It's especially helpful if you're migrating existing code, as you
    can slowly make things immutable without rewriting every piece of code that
    touches them.</p>\n
    <h2>The Missing Piece: Serializing with transit-js</h2>\n
    <p>There's one last piece to consider: serialization. If you're using
    custom data types, <code>JSON.stringify</code> is no longer an option. But
    <code>JSON.stringify</code> was never very good anyway, you can't even
    serialize ES6 <code>Map</code> or <code>Set</code> instances.</p>\n
    <p><a href=
    "/&quot;https://github.com/cognitect/transit-js/&quot;">transit-js</a> is a
    great library written by <a href=
    "/&quot;https://twitter.com/swannodette/&quot;">David Nolen</a> that
    defines an extensible data transfer format. By default you cannot throw
    <code>Map</code> or <code>Set</code> instances into it, but the crucial
    difference is that you can easily transcribe custom types into something
    that transit understands. In fact, the <a href=
    "/&quot;https://github.com/glenjamin/transit-immutable-js/blob/master/index.js/&quot;">
    full code</a> for serializing and deserializing the entire set of
    Immutable.js types is less than 150 lines long.</p>\n
    <p>Transit is also much smarter about how it encodes types. For example, it
    knows that map keys might be complex types as well, so it's easy to tell
    how it how to serialize <code>Map</code> types. Using the <a href=
    "/&quot;https://github.com/glenjamin/transit-immutable-js/&quot;"><code>transit-immutable-js</code></a>
    library (referenced above) to support Immutable.js, now we can do things
    like this:</p>\n
    <pre>
    <code>let { toJSON, fromJSON } = require('transit-immutable-js'); let map = Immutable.Map(); map = map.set(Immutable.Map({ x: 1, y: 2 }), \"value\"); let newMap = fromJSON(toJSON(map)); newMap.get(Immutable.Map({ x: 1, y: 2 })); </code></pre>\n
    <p>Value equality combined with transit's easy-breezy map serialization
    gives us a simple way to use these patterns consistently across any system.
    In fact, my blog builds the query cache on the server when server-rendering
    and then sends that cache to the client, so the cache is still fully
    intact. This use case was actually the main reason I switched to
    transit.</p>\n
    <p>It would be easy to serialize ES6 <code>Map</code> types as well, but if
    you have complex keys I'm not sure how you would use the unserialized
    instance without value equality. There are still probably uses for
    serializing them though.</p>\n
    <p>If you have mixed normal JavaScript objects and Immutable.js objects,
    serializing with transit will also keep all those types in tact. While I
    recommend against mixing them, transit will deserialize each object into
    the appropriate type, whereas using raw JSON means you'd convert everything
    to an Immutable.js type when deserializing (assuming you do
    <code>Immutable.fromJS(JSON.parse(str))</code>).</p>\n
    <p>You can extend transit to serialize anything, like <code>Date</code>
    instances or any custom types. Check out <a href=
    "/&quot;https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format/&quot;">transit-format</a>
    for how it encodes types.</p>\n
    <p>If you use seamless-immutable, you are already restricting yourself to
    only use builtin JavaScript (and therefore JSON-compatible) types, so you
    can just use <code>JSON.stringify</code>. While simpler, you lose out on
    the extensibility; it's all about tradeoffs.</p>\n
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n
    <p>Immutability provides a lot of benefits, but whether or not you need to
    use full-blown persistent data structures provided by Immutable.js depends
    on the app. I suspect a lot of apps are fine copying objects, as most of
    them are relatively small.</p>\n
    <p>You win simplicity at the cost of features though; not only is the API a
    lot more limited you don't get value equality. Additionally, it may be hard
    later on to switch to Immutable.js if you find out you need the performance
    gains of structural sharing.</p>\n
    <p>Generally I would recommend hiding the data structure details,
    especially if you use Immutable.js, to the outside world. Try to conform to
    JavaScript's default protocols for objects and arrays, i.e.
    <code>obj.property</code> and <code>arr[0]</code>. It should be possible to
    quickly wrap Immutable objects with these interfaces, but more research is
    needed.</p>\n
    <p>This is especially true in Redux, where you <em>will</em> want to change
    how the app state is structured in the future. You have this problem even
    if your app state is a normal JavaScript object. Outside users shouldn't
    break if you move things around in the app state. Provide a way to query
    the app state structure instead, at least just by abstracting out data
    accesses with functions. More complex solutions like <a href=
    "/&quot;https://github.com/facebook/relay/&quot;">Relay</a> and <a href=
    "/&quot;http://netflix.github.io/falcor//&quot;">Falcor</a> solve this too
    because a query language is the default way to access data.</p>\n

    native JavaScript objects</p>\n
